## 🏛️ About IMMIT

IMMIT (**Intelligent Morphogenic Materials for Infrastructure Technologies**) is an advanced material science AI model operating under **Project Icarus**. Our mission is to push the boundaries of material science through quantum-level research and develop next-generation structural materials for industrial, commercial, and construction applications.

As a private institute for advanced materials innovation and deployment, IMMIT represents the convergence of:
- **Intelligent Systems** → Adaptive, responsive, programmable materials
- **Morphogenic Design** → Self-forming, growth-oriented structures  
- **Infrastructure Technologies** → Bridges, cities, utilities, and civilization-scale systems
